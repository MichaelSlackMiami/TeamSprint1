        <p> Simply put, virtual reality is (at least in theory) the most immersive experience you can have. It's like a 3D movie on steroids, where the screen has completely surrounded you, entirely replacing the real world with a virtual one. Typically using a special headset, virtual reality offers 360 degrees of immersion. This technology held obvious appeal for entertainment, and gaming in particular. Many games already offered fully 3D enviornments, but they were restricted within a flat screen. With VR, the camera and the player's eyes could be one and the same. </p>

        <p> Like other gaming mediums, VR comes in many shapes and sizes. Cutting-edge VR headsets are available for hundreds or even thousands of dollars, or you could pick one up for $10 from your local Walmart. VR games are the same way: some were scrapped together in someone's spare time, and others are fully developed games that can go toe-to-toe with mainline console titles.

        <h2> "Virtual reality is all about democratizing storytelling. It gives people more control over the experience. Instead of trying to force a story upon you, we try and give you this huge playground through which you will create stories that you will then share through this medium." - Curtis Hickman, VR developer </h2>
