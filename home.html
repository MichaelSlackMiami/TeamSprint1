        <h2> So what even IS virtual reality? </h2>
        
        <p> Simply put, virtual reality is (at least in theory) the most immersive experience you can have. It's like a 3D movie on steroids, where the screen has completely surrounded you, entirely replacing the real world with a virtual one. Typically using a special headset, virtual reality offers 360 degrees of immersion. This technology held obvious appeal for entertainment, and gaming in particular. Many games already offered fully 3D enviornments, but they were restricted within a flat screen. With VR, the camera and the player's eyes could be one and the same. </p>
